#####How long did you spend working on this project?
#####What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

###What two additional features did you build? Why?
#1.A way for customers to cancel their order. I made the del_order to delete the relate transaction.
I think it's a basic function.
#2. Better ways to find transactions
I think if we can find the transactions by customer name or product name is more easy to find what we want.

#####Where do you still have room to grow?
