##### How long did you spend working on this project?
10 hours
I'm a newbie in programming.
It's really tough for newbie.

##### What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
OOP concept still confused me, I always stuck when I try to get the data from object.
for ex. get name from @@customers.
especially in the transaction.rb,  because @@transaction include the Product and Customer objects.
It's hard for me to understand what kind of data is inside the object and how I can use it.

### #What two additional features did you build? Why?
# 1.A way for customers to cancel their order. I made the del_order to delete the relate transaction.
I think it's a basic function.
# 2. Better ways to find transactions
I think if we can find the transactions by customer name or product name is more easy to find what we want.

##### Where do you still have room to grow?
Everywhere?
I take too much time to stuck on the simple question.
